RoboCamp
This website is supposed to be a one stop solution for all needs and problems of Robotics enthusiasts. It provides information about, and allows to register for, various workshops and
events regarding robotics. It also has an e-commerce section for tools reqd. for robotics. Also, it provides various courses, blogs, and project ideas for robotics enthusiasts. There is no 
such specialised app for robotics yet, and this projectc solves their problems quite efficiently.

This website currently only has frontend, not backend, done mostly in HTML and CSS.

The project was created entirely within the time frame of the hackathon, that is, within the time span of 36 hours, using Bootstrap framework.
